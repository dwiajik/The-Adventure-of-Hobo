# The Adventure of Hobo

Help Hobo to complete his pursuit of hidden treasure! He has to collect six parts of the key to unlock the hidden treasure. 

The Adventure of Hobo is an RPG-like console game that has six mini games inside. This main character of this game is Hobo.

This console based game was created in my first semester in college (UGM). The Adventure of Hobo was developed by five person team. We developed this game in order to complete assignment of Fundamental Programming course. The assignment was was to command prompt game. We did not know about git in that moment, so there is just one commit, LOL. The code was written in C++ and we used Dev-C++ IDE to develop this game.

The executable file is not included in this git. If you have problem compiling this game into exeecutable, or you have another question, please contact dwi.aji.kurniawan@gmail.com
